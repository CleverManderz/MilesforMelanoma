MilesforMelanoma (MRF) Raffle Give Away
================

I developed an iPad only entry form to raffle off 3 types of prizes. It was presented at an Iron Man Competition and the lucky winner was picked randomly with a custom script I created. 

To test out the demo.

Fill out the form (Don't worry this campaign has been over for a while, but feel free to use dummy text)
After you fill out a redirect to a thank you page similiar to the raffle page.

Once you are logged in you will see the entries for the Raffle, click on the "Draw Winner" and it will randomly pick someone.
